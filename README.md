# Face-Finder
A facial recognition application created using React.js and the Clarifai API. The single-page web app is supposed to display a box around each persons face within any given photo by pasting its link. The front-end for the projet is nearly complete after I adjust to the clarifai update. I plan to update my repo once i finish the back-end and clean up the code.
***THE CLARIFAI API HAS UNDERGONE CHANGES AS OF 9/11/2019, SO THE APP WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY UNTIL I ADJUST TO THEIR UPDATE.*****
