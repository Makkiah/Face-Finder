# Face-Finder
A facial recognition application created using React.js and the Clarifai API. The single-page web app is supposed to display a box around each persons face within any given photo by pasting its link.  ***THE CLARIFAI API HAS UNDERGONE CHANGES AS OF 9/11/2019, SO THE APP WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY UNTIL I ADJUST TO THEIR UPDATE.*****
